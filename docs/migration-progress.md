## Next Steps

   - Run database migration script

2. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Connect repository to Vercel

## Notes

- The TypeScript errors in the IDE are expected when viewing files in isolation. They'll resolve when building the project.
- Remember to keep your environment variables secure and never commit them to the repository.
- Consider setting up Prisma Accelerate for better connection pooling if needed in the future.
